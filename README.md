# NewYorkTimeClone

<a href="https://satya12325.github.io/NewYorkTimeClone/" target="_blank"><h1>The New York Times</h1></a>
<p>This is a project undertaken by  Satyabrata Das, Paarug Sethi and Vandna Tiwari as part of the Full Stack Web Development course at Masai School.</p>

<p>The New York Times is an American daily newspaper based in New York City with a worldwide readership. Founded in 1851, the Times has since won 132 Pulitzer Prizes, and has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record". It is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S.

For this project, we had to clone their online website using the open source API they have provided for the public to use and the concepts we had learned during the preceding unit-3 of the course.
